# TeamDyamix SDK for PHP
This is an unofficial PHP SDK for the [TeamDynamix REST APIs](https://solutions.teamdynamix.com/TDWebApi/).

A provider for Laravel is included, although this package can be used in non-Laravel PHP projects too.

**ðŸš¨ Note**: This is an early release. The API is unstable and will probably change.
